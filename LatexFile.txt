\section{Introduction to algorithm}

My algorithm evaluates whether or not the input year is a leap year. It does this by first checking for the input mod(4) if this is not 0 the year is not a leap year and that conclusion is printed in the terminal. 


If the input mod(4) is equal to 0 the algorithm needs to check further and then checks for its mod(100) if this is not 0 the year is in fact a leap year and that fact is printed in the terminal.
If it were equal to 0 the algorithm needs to check further and then checks if the input mod(400) is equal to 0. 



if it is input is in fact a leap year and this is printed but if it is not equal to 0 it is not a leap year and this is printed. On the next page you can find a Diagram of the algorithm
